# Algorithm Visualizations
This project aims to provide interactive visualizations for various algorithms, starting with John Conway's "Game of Life." 
The goal is to create an educational tool that makes understanding complex algorithms easier and more engaging.

## Current Support

### 1. John Conway's "Game of Life"
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve through a series of iterations based on a set of simple rules. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

#### Features:
- **Start, Stop, Rewind, and Forward Controls**: Control the simulation with intuitive buttons.
- **Random Initialization**: Generate random initial states with a single click.
- **Responsive Grid**: The grid dynamically adjusts to fit the canvas size, providing a clear and engaging visualization.
- **Gridlines Toggle**: Option to show or hide gridlines for better visualization.
- **Scale Factor**: Adjust the scale of the grid to zoom in and out.
- **Custom State Creation**: Create and edit custom initial states by clicking and dragging on the grid.
- **Speed Control Slider**: Adjust the speed of the simulation using a slider.

## In the Works

### 1. Graphical Construction of Initial States
- **Pattern Libraries**: Predefined patterns such as gliders, pulsars, and more for quick setup.

### 2. Improved UI
- **More Intuitive UI**: Visual instruction on how to use.
- **Color Options**: Enable users to choose how to color cells.

### 3. Additional Algorithms
Expand the project to include visualizations of other algorithms, including variations of the Game of Life and sorting algorithms. Planned features:
- **HighLife**: A variation of the Game of Life with different survival and birth rules.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizations of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
