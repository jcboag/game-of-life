# Algorithm Visualizations

This project aims to provide interactive visualizations for various algorithms, starting with John Conway's "Game of Life." 
The goal is to create an educational tool that makes understanding complex algorithms easier and more engaging.

## Current Support

### 1. John Conway's "Game of Life"
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve through a series of iterations based on a set of simple rules. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

#### Features:
- **Start, Stop, Rewind, and Forward Controls**: Control the simulation with intuitive buttons.
- **Random Initialization**: Generate random initial states with a single click.
- **Responsive Grid**: The grid dynamically adjusts to fit the canvas size, providing a clear and engaging visualization.

## In the Works

### 1. Graphical Construction of Initial States
Enable users to create and modify their own initial states graphically. This will allow for a more interactive and customized experience, letting users explore various scenarios and patterns.

### 2. Improved UI
Enhance the user interface by adding buttons, sliders, and other interactive elements to control the simulation state. This includes:
- **Speed Control Slider**: Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- **Grid Size Selector**: Change the size of the grid to explore different scenarios.
- **Pattern Libraries**: Predefined patterns such as gliders, pulsars, and more for quick setup.

### 3. Additional Algorithms
Expand the project to include visualizations of other algorithms, including variations of the Game of Life and sorting algorithms. Planned features:
- **HighLife**: A variation of the Game of Life with different survival and birth rules.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizations of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
